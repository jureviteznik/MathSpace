Game for kids to learn multiplication

### How to play:
Careful, meteors might hit the space ship! Save it by solving the equation in each meteor.

Click on the meteor and input dial should pop up. Input the answer to the equation and the ship is saved!

Example: if the numbers inside a meteor are 4 and 6, then the answer is 24 (4x6), so you should input 2 and then 4 on the input dial
